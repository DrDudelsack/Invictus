 arganthonios_heritage:0 "Legado de Argantonio"
 arganthonios_heritage_desc:0 "Argantonio fue el último rey conocido de Tartessos antes del colapso del reino bajo el protagonismo fenicio tras la batalla de Alalia, en la que la armada cartaginés-etrusca derrotó a los griegos focianos. Ahora sus sucesores han recuperado su importancia perdida y retoman su rico legado con un nuevo y más fuerte estado que desafiará al pasar del tiempo."

 fezzani_heritage_desc:0 "The tribes of the Fezzan were masters of desert combat and tamers of the numerous oases of Libya. While they struggle against properly trained legions in open field, their desert guerilla fighting and use of more mobile units presented an everlasting challenge to Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans alike."
 macrobian_heritage:0 "Somali Heritage"
 macrobian_heritage_desc:0 "What the peoples of modern Somalia lacked in land warfare they made up for tremendously at sea. They were prolific traders of exotic goods, pirates and coastal raiders, taking advantage of those with inferior seamanship. Their trade network extended from India to the Mediterranean, and down the eastern coast of Africa, giving them diplomatic contacts across the known world."

 tartessian_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tartessos"
 tartessian_heritage_desc:0 "Many centuries ago Tartessos was one of the most important commercial and political centers of Iberia. A heritage that lives on to this day, even if the tribes that dominate the area would largely be foreign to the old Tartessians."
 default_heritage:0 "Unremarkable Heritage"
 default_heritage_desc:0 "Most peoples have something to be proud of but this is not the case for the citizens of this state. Long forgotten by the outside world they continue to lead uneventful, if peaceful, lives and have no hopes or aspirations of note."
