gadiran_heritage_desc:0 "Founded as a major port city in the mid-late 8th century by Tyrian merchants and colonists, Gadir became the greatest trading hub beyond the Pillars of Herakles under the patronage of the god Melqart and his Oracle. Bolstered originally in its power by the large wealth of silver and precious metals mined from the nearby cliffs and mountains, Gadir leads a strong union of former Punic colonies, developing and controlling the Atlantic trade from the Cassiterides in the north to Arambys in the south."

We have four options, but the time window only allows for one opertation. It would be a shame, should we let this opportunity pass away without acting on it. My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], choose wisely." 
gadir_inv.16.a:0 "The people are the key to victory."
gadir_inv.16.b:0 "The army needs to be weakened."
gadir_inv.16.c:0 "Without leadership they are weak."
gadir_inv.16.d:0 "Conquered, they pose no threat."
gadir_inv.16.e:0 "We cannot spare the resources"
gadir_inv.17.t:0 "Raided Territory"
gadir_inv.17.desc:0 "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], news from the borders just reached us. #¥ Carthaginian#! troops have raided some of our lands bordering their own. Our advisor have different recommendations as to what we should do next. One demands retaliation, a second wants to pour resources into preventing any similar incidents and a third thinks we can demand Carthage pay us back. Our last options would be to simply ignore this incident or to quitely build back up. These may not be the most popular however..." 
gadir_inv.17.a:0 "Retaliate."
gadir_inv.17.b:0 "Prevent any further incidents."
gadir_inv.17.c:0 "Send messengers to Carthage."
gadir_inv.17.tt:0 "We'll send a messenger to Carthage, demanding recompensation. We will await their response."
gadir_inv.17.d:0 "Repair and restore the settlements."
gadir_inv.17.e:0 "Who cares about peasants?"
gadir_inv.18.t:0 "Allegations from Iberia"
gadir_inv.18.desc:0 "Just now, messengers from Iberia have arrived. They hail from the rich port-city of #Y Gadir#!. Their accusations are grave however: they claim, that we raided their territories and now they demand recompensation. Such insolence from a small city on the edge of the world..."
gadir_inv.18.a:0 "Ignore theses claims."
gadir_inv.18.b:0 "It is but a paltry sum - and good relations never hurt."
gadir_inv.19.t:0 "Carthage's Response"
gadir_inv.19.desc_1:0 "Our demands have been met and the damge repaid, but money cannot replace men. We are not yet ready to confront Carthage, so it will have to suffice. For now." 
gadir_inv.19.desc_2:0 "Curse these Carthaginian dogs. They will pay for the damage done one day! Our poor cities raided and their inhabitants killed. What did we do? \nCarthage, may you rot in Baal's name and may Melqart sink your ships!" 
gadir_inv.19.a:0 "Not all of them are rotten..."
gadir_inv.19.b:0 "This raid will be repaid tenfold."

gadir_inv.20.desc:0 "Recently, three merchants have approached us and presented some interesting plans. The city of #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! is a strategic point on the other side of the Atlas mountains. The merchants all have different proposals as to how to extend our influence there. They decided on this to take revenge for their ships being blockaded by Carthage a few months ago. We should not forget that their prices differ according to the resources needed for their respective plans to succeed." 
gadir_inv.20.a:0 "We need to control everything."
gadir_inv.20.b:0 "The richest need to obey our whims."
gadir_inv.20.c:0 "A token presence will siffice."

Henceforth, #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! will be part of our realm - again. Carthage never ought to have taken it from us..." 
gadir_inv.21.desc_2:0 "The merchant we sent to #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! was successful. He managed to bribe enough officials and made us popular enough that they defected. The locals organised themselves and are now our loyal vassals." 
gadir_inv.21.desc_3:0 "The merchant we sent managed to convince some people to leave #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! and join us in our efforts agaonst #Y Carthage#!. Sadly he wasn't persuasive enough to take #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! over..." 
gadir_inv.21.a:0 "Good News!"
gadir_inv.22.t:0 "The Merchants in #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#!"
gadir_inv.22.desc:0 "We got successful in our capture of Rusaddir. Our merchants have two different proposals as to how we should proceed from here: we can either vassalise the city, or make it part of our own realm. Once thing is certain however: Carthage will not take kindly to us taking back our city, but what they consider is theft."

gadir_inv.27.t:0 "Seeking an Alliance"
gadir_inv.27.desc:0 "With Carthage being on our doorstep, we should find a partner that would help us against our nemesis - even if we pretend to submit for now. Because now, we are alone, and a lone wolf is easy prey. \nWe can either ask #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('alliance_target_1')GetName]#! or #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('alliance_target_2')GetName]#! for an alliance. It is important however that they respect us, otherwise they will just laugh at our faces..."

gadir_inv.30.t:0 "An Offer Spurned"
gadir_inv.30.desc:0 "Sadly, our offer of partnership and alliance were rejected, yet we should not despair, for there are other avenues. If they are not our allies, then they will be our foes! \nBesides, our [ROOT.GetCountryGetRulerTitle] had a second choice for an alliance in mind. If we haven't already, maybe we should ask them?"
gadir_inv.30.a:0 "The water's under the bridge."
gadir_inv.30.b:0 "Yes, we shall inquire with the other state."
