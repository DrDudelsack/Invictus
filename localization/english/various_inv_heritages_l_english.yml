#Socosia
Socosian_heritage:0 "Socosian Heritage"
Socosian_heritage_desc:0 "Secluded, set along the Mauretanian mountains brushing against the Iberian Sea, the Socossi maintain access both to the many Phoenician and Punic trading posts and colonies dotting the coast for access to the wider Mediterranean, as well as the safety of the mountains. It is said that the Libyan god Anti stood on top of the peaks as he challenged passers-bye and fought even Herakles. Perhaps they have inherited his titanic strength."
#Mauretania
Mauretanian_heritage:0 "Mauretanian Heritage"
Mauretanian_heritage_desc:0 "The kingdom of the Mauri, Mauretania, later coming to refer to the region touching the the sea beyond the Pillars of Herakles (Mauretania Tingitana), but also the region next to it (Mauretania Caesariensis), was a confederation of hill-based tribes brought together under the power of a few ruling ‘familiae’. The Mauri were a blessing and a curse to the colonial powers in the Libyan and European continents, trading rich goods from the mountainous interior lands with outsiders while also raiding their settlements on occasion, even crossing the sea itself to raid the Iberian region of Baetica."
#Nectiberia
Nectiberian_heritage:0 "Nectiberean Heritage"
Nectiberian_heritage_desc:0 "Settled at the foot of the Atlas mountain range, the Nectiberi can be found stuck between a rock and a hard place, literally, with two significant competitors in the notorious Autololes to their west and the raid-happy Mauri to their north. Their only means of escape, should an invasion or aggressive migration occur, would be through the mountains themselves. Luckily, they have the Pyrrhon Plain at their side, so sustenance is not one of their many problems."
#Autolalia
Autolalian_heritage:0 "Autolalian Heritage"
Autolalian_heritage_desc:0 "Strabo describes them as “the most powerful of the Libyan nations” while Pliny the Elder fears their ferocious nature. If it is to be believed that they once had Iarbas as their king, then Dido/Elissa and great Carthage too once feared their tribe because Iarbas was so aggressive a suitor of the Punic queen. While a Gaetulian tribe, the Autololes were more well known for their ravenous behavior, having fed on the flesh of terrible wild beasts."
#Daphnitaea
Daphnitaean_heritage:0 "Daphnitaean Heritage"
Daphnitaean_heritage_desc:0 "Spread farther away from the feet of mountains and too far from the shore, the Daphnitae are confined to the vast horizon of endless desert which expands seemingly forever in all directions. Perhaps one of them may see a lone camel passing by, a lost Garamantine warrior from ages past, riding by on an old chariot, or they might see any sort of torturous vision appear amidst the hot haze of the homogenous sands. So is the life of those living among the dunes, traveling from watering hole to watering hole."
#Capariensis
Capariensian_heritage:0 "Capariensian Heritage"
Capariensian_heritage_desc:0 "Confined to the hills which serve as tactical positions in case of ambush or invasion, the Capariensi must be a wary and overly cautious people in order to survive, their backs against the last visible rocks before the endless desert. There is little to look forward to in life, save for arrival at the next oasis where one can forget the taste of dust and sand for a little while."
#Abannaea
Abannaean_heritage:0 "Abannaean Heritage"
Abannaean_heritage_desc:0 "Connected to both the busy worlds of the eastern Numidian and Gaetulian tribes and the greener parts of north western Libya as well as the rocky, sandy corridor past the final mountains before the endless desert, the Abannae are in a unique position to play on the weaknesses of nearby greater powers while remaining in the safety of their territory, which few wish to follow them into."
#Lixitae
Lixitan_heritage:0 "Lixitan Heritage"
Lixitan_heritage_desc:0 "The only friendly and helpful natives which Hanno the Navigator found useful enough to take aboard his ship as translators for the remainder of his journey, the Lixitae were a unique tribe among many - much more favorable than their vicious Atutololian neighbors. Perhaps these people are so uniquely friendly because they happen to live in such a fertile river valley hidden between the mountains."
#Perorsia
Perorsian_heritage:0 "Perorsian Heritage"
Perorsian_heritage_desc:0 "Living north of the river Daras, where it passes up into the mountains, the Perorsi were adjacent to the wild Canarii who shared their food with dogs. They live at the foot of the Atlas mountains, near both the black, sandy, desert horizon and the strange forest with dangerous beasts."
#Canaria
Canarian_heritage:0 "Canarian Heritage"
Canarian_heritage_desc:0 "These people, the Canarii, are named so because they are known to share their meals with dogs and spread the entrails of their prey, wild beasts, on a common plate. Their home is the lush forest around Mount Atlas which is home to all manners of beast including, at the largest, elephants and, at smallest, serpents. This forest home can be found surrounded by a black desert, peppered with dark, rocky sand coming from below the ground."
#Massaesylia
Massaesylian_heritage:0 "Massaesylian Heritage"
Massaesylian_heritage_desc:0 "Bordering the Mauri in the west and controlling the western confederation of Numidian tribes, the Massaesylii were able to consolidate cultural and political control over many individual ‘familiae’ in response to the pressure of Mediterranean powers such as Carthage, as well as the consolidation and recognition of other segmented groups such as the Massylii in the east with whom they were antagonistic in their attempts to bring together all the Numidian tribes under one ruler. Still, they were fierce on the battlefield with their famous Numidian cavalry, as were their adjacent rivals."
#Massylia
Massylian_heritage:0 "Massylian Heritage"
Massylian_heritage_desc:0 "Most likely beginning as a few ‘familiae,’ the Massylii took over political and cultural control of many Numidian tribes during the process of becoming a protectorate state of Carthage, held together by the recognition of a great power and the intricacies of tribal segmentation and consolidation. Like all Numidian tribes, the Massylii were known for their tactics with the swift and powerful Numidian horses and cavalry divisions, which they used to serve both Carthage and other powers, and also to wage war on their Massaesyli counterparts. Their subjugation is ironic and insulting, considering how Carthage once paid tribute to Numidian kings."

Heritage_of_the_Great_Invading_Asparagus_desc:0 "The Gaetuli are often an indiscernible people, ranging across a vast landscape and having many sub tribes which can only be called “Gaetuli”. Yet the main body of the Gaetulian tribes, on the border with and often mixing both biologically and culturally with the related Numidian tribes, has been notable for quite a few things. These include invading everyone around them, indiscriminately, trading their exotic and dangerous wildlife, such as the Gaetulian lion, off to Mediterranean powers for sport, and growing asparagus of a size greater than two men and thick as the reeds found in the marshes of Cyprus. So it has been that these people are a great threat to their neighbors, and a constant source of amazement."
#Musulamia
Musulamian_heritage:0 "Musulamian Heritage"
Musulamian_heritage_desc:0 "A confederation of smaller Gaetulian tribes, the Musulamii inhabited the desert region west and south of the Carthaginian coastline. Maintaining many customs of the general Gaetuli peoples but identifying as their own political segmentation, the Musulamii shared close boundaries and bonds with the neighboring Numidian tribes of the Massylii and contributed to the mixed ethnic makeup of the area, held together socially by a shared linguistic base."
#Gyzantia
Tritonian_heritage:0 "Tritonian Heritage"
Tritonian_heritage_desc:0 "Setting themselves up along the shores of Lake Tritonis, where Athene Tritogeneia was cared for by the nymphs under Triton after her birth, the Gyzantes lived in a wondrous and prosperous land hidden among the deserts. The Libyan goddess Neith also possibly originated here and became the model for Greek Athena. It is said that there were many bees around the lake, and that the Gyzantes made good use of them, extracting immeasurable amounts of honey. It is also said that they painted themselves red and ate the flesh of monkeys which could be found, innumerable, among the hills. Perhaps these men and women even rode the elephants living there, frequenting the shore of the great lake, its tributary river, or the many spacious watering holes."

Heritage_of_the_Leather_Legged_Women_desc:0 "The Gindanes are notable for living near the sea, having once occupied the isle of Meninx long before the Lotus-Eaters, the Lotophagi, came to live in that place and eat of the lotus fruit which intoxicates the mind and turns away any person from life outside the shade of the lotus tree. Herodotus reports that the women within the Gindanes tribe would show how greatly they had been loved by the men with the addition of a leather anklet after a night spent with each new man. In this way, all the people knew which woman had been loved by the most men."

Heritage_of_the_Ostrich_Shield_desc:0 "Herodotus reports that these people “by letting the locks about the crown of their head grow long, while they clip them close everywhere else, make their hair resemble a crest” (Histories Book 4). It is likely that, because they are known for their ostrich shields, that they worked ostrich skin over a wooden base and were, to a man, as unique as their ostrich. These people live below the notable “Hill of the Graces,” which bears a thick forest and is greener than all the barren wastes of Libya."

Androgynous_heritage_desc:0 "A subtribe of the Macae, breaking off on their own at a time unknown, the Machlyes were a unique people who lie largely within myth and rumor. It is said that when they are even children they try their hand at basic warfare, fighting each other and their neighbors with sticks and stones. It is also said that they maintain halves of both man and woman, having on their body the breast of both a man and a woman, one to a side."
#Psyllia
Snake_Bite_heritage:0 "Snake Bite Heritage"
Snake_Bite_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that these ancient peoples test the strength and worthiness of their children with the venom of the snake, as they also do their wives for the purpose of bearing these strong children. Their origin is unknown, though it is known that they are old - oh so old - and have been cast adrift on the arid deserts by either high gales of searing wind or the strength of the nomadic Nasamones. They remain, to all outsiders, known as snake charmers, posessers of the most exotic means of both healing and poisoning."
#Nasamonia
Nasamonian_heritage:0 "Nasamonian Heritage"
Nasamonian_heritage_desc:0 "A nomadic Numidian tribe traveling along the eastern deserts, stopping at the rich Augila and Siwa oases where the only life in the area grows far to the south of lush Cyrenaica (there they pick dates and pour crushed locust remains over milk), the Nasamones were a fierce tribe who once lived near the coastline of the Mediterranean but were forced out of the area by the many Greek colonists such as those Therans who founded Cyrene. Noted for supposedly defeating the snake charmer Psylli in war, the Nasamones were never truly subject to anyone, and would be great obstacles for any future conquerors in the region."
#Cetiania

Cetianian_heritage_desc:0 "The Cetiani live by and control the upper Mulucha (modern Moulouya) river, which comes from the Greek meaning “a marsh mallow” -  yum. With the safety of the Atlas mountain range at their back and the precious and often exotic goods found in that area, the Cetiani have quite the assortment of things to send downstream in order to trade with the riverside Phoneician/Punic settlement of Bouhout and coastal Rusaddir."

#Thamusida
Thamusidan_heritage:0 "Thamusidan Heritage"
Thamusidan_heritage_desc:0 "Originally a Mauretanian Berber settlement, Thamusida, likely meaning “swampland” in the native language, became occupied, at least partially, by Phoenician settlers and traders in the sixth century BCE. The town, which lies on the Sububa river, was part of a trade network along the river with the inland settlement of Banasa and was also part of the expansive trade routes connecting north to Tingis at the Pillars of Herakles."
#Lixus
Lixan_heritage:0 "Lixan Heritage"
Lixan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by the Phoenicians sometime in the eighth century BCE, Lixus was a multicultural hub with a strong native Mauretanian population living in close-knit neighborhood structures alongside the Phoenician colonists and traders. By the Hellenistic period, the city notably relied a great deal on its export of fish in order to support its economy."
#Kuass
Kuassan_heritage:0 "Kuassan Heritage"
Kuassan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Phoenicians at least as early as the seventh century BCE, Kuass, possibly coming from the Libyan "Akwass," was notable for its wealth of salt pools and production factories. This colony acted as a secondary site to the main production houses at Gadir for a notable set of red-slip tableware produced in the forms of common items such as amphorae."
#Rusaddir
Rusaddiran_heritage:0 "Rusaddiran Heritage"
Rusaddiran_heritage_desc:0 "Rusaddir, “The mighty cape,” was an important sight for any Phoneician or Punic sailor on their way to the Iberian peninsula. The city had a naturally-made and well-defended harbor on account of the rocks forming the cape which it draws its name from. It was the easternmost of the colony system connecting to the Pillars of Herakles and within the influence of Iberian Gadir."
#Iol
Iolan_heritage:0 "Iolan Heritage"
Iolan_heritage_desc:0 "Established sometime either in the sixth or fifth century BCE, Iol, or the “Sandy Island,” was an islet port which became one of the most important Punic centers in the region, minting the first coins in Numidia. It was notably fortified by the third century and the images on its coins depicted the fish it would sell abroad."
#Ibasim
Ibasim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Abandoned"
Ibasim_heritage_desc:0 "The islands of Ibiza/Evissa and Formentera, Phoenician Yboshim and Roman Frumenteria, labeled as their own island chain by the Greeks. The Pityusae, or “rich in pines,” were a uniquely scarcely inhabited area when the Phoenician settlers and traders arrived as back-migrants in the eighth century BCE from other colonies on the coast of Iberia. These islands, unlike the the talayotic-culture-inhabited Balearic islands of Majorca and Menorca to the east, experienced a vanishing of their population or perhaps a mass-abandonment after the Bronze Age collapse up until Phoenician occupation. The Phoenicians settled over barely populated previous settlements, first establishing an outpost at a southern cove on Ibiza before building their main port at the site of Yboshim, the namesake city for the island. The Pityusae were important ports for any ships traveling the northern route of the Mediterranean Sea to and from the Iberian coast."
#Utica
Utica_heritage:0 "Heritage of the First Colonizers"
Utica_heritage_desc:0 "The first Phoenician colony in the western Mediterranean, founded near the end of the ninth century BCE, Utica was set up at a strong geo-economic position at the mouth of the Bagradas river and imported goods from all over the Phoenician sphere of influence, including Levantine-Phoenician, Nuragic, Greek, Tartessian, Villanovan (early Etruscan), and Libyan wares at its expansive port and also saw a great deal of trade run through its connected port town of Rus Eshmun “Cape Eshmun” when the Bagrada changed its natural course and the original river path silted over, locking Utica into an inland position. Utica maintained complete autonomy until around 540 BCE, when it came into political arrangements as a powerful ally of Carthage, though it still competed with the new Punic capital economically."
#Kerkouane
Kerkouanan_heritage:0 "Kerkouanan Heritage"
Kerkouanan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the first half of the sixth century BCE, Kerkouane largely produced dyes and garum, owing to the size of its fishing production centers, its commercial centers, and the salt mines. The city acted as a large and prosperous trade center, made more effective by its regularized city-planning grid structure. The main necropolis for the city contains burials with votive goods ranging from foreign locations as far as Egypt."
#Hadrametum
Hadrametan_heritage:0 "Hadrametan Heritage"
Hadrametan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Tyrian settlers in the very late ninth century BCE, Hadrametum, its original name most likely meaning “south” or “southern place,” was more of a civil center of Phoenician occupation rather than a commercial center such as the many trade ports lining the north African coast which retained smaller populations but emphasized the exporting of luxury and exotic resources from interior trading and mining. This was accompanied by its well laid out building planning and the incorporation of a tophet for socio-religious use, as was characteristic in the major urban centers of colonial Phoenicia. In 310 BCE, Hadrametum was briefly captured by Agathocles of Syracuse near the end of the 7th Sicilian War, but was released when the Sicilians could not effectively keep the warfront in Africa after a long campaign of attrition and returned to Sicily where peace arrangements were soon drawn up."
#Leptis Minor
Leptis_Minor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Leptis Minor"
Leptis_Minor_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Tyrian merchants, Leptis Minor (Roman Leptis Parva), not to be confused with Leptis Magna (greater Leptis) farther south, possibly meant “construction” or “naval station” in the original Phoenician, inscribed LPQ and sometimes LPQY in the semitic triliteral root system abbreviation. While it came under the socio-political domination of Carthage like the rest of most of North Africa, Leptis Minor maintained its wealthy status and in later periods was noted for paying a daily tribute of 1 Attic Talent, almost 60 pounds of pure silver."
#Thapsus
Thapsan_heritage:0 "Thapsan Heritage"
Thapsan_heritage_desc:0 "Bearing in its name the native Libyan prefix "tha-" but a typical Phoenician/Punic ending, the settlement maye have been a native site later taken over by the Phoenicians as had happened at multiple towns across much of Africa. Set upon a defensible promontory near a wealth of salt flats for mining, Thapsus was set up as a commercial center and a waystation for merchant ships en-route to the Iberian and Atlantic coasts."
#Achola
Acholan_heritage:0 "Acholan Heritage"
Acholan_heritage_desc:0 "A colony founded by Cathaginians from Melite, Achola/Acholla was built on the northern coast of the Lesser Syrtis bay and retained several unique aspects of native Miletan culture, such as inhumation burials, as opposed to the typical Punic tradition of cremation burials. The nearby island of Cercinna served as a strong look-out post for naval activity in the bay and hosted small settlements of native and Phoenician types. Perhaps these people took advantage of the octopus hunting grounds surrounding the Cercinna archipelago."
#Emporia
Emporia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kohanim and the Lotus Eaters"
Emporia_heritage_desc:0 "Likely coming from the Greek ‘emporion’ or trading post, the region of Emporia, while not quite clear in the ancient sources, seems to have encompassed several rich Phoenician/Punic trading outposts and merchant cities. The area was also quite fertile, supplied by the Lesser Syrtis and its connected rivers, and the nearby lake Tritonis. Ancient Takapes, a native Libyan name possibly alluding to the site's pre-Phoenician origin, was noted for its local springs which provided for many farmers and cultivators. But there was a more alluring nature to Emporia. It is said that the island of Meninx, not far offshore from the town of Gergis, was the spot at which Odysseus landed during his famous voyage, and that it was once lived upon solely by the native Gindanes, who ate the lotus which deprives men of all ambition but the consumption of the flower. Even stranger, there also exists a legend on the island among the small Jewish community that, when Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the temple of Solomon, many in the Kohanim priestly-cast of society in flew the holy city for the shores of Meninx and brought with them the door to the temple itself and several foundation stones. However, many claims are laid regarding the island and, too, all of Libya."
#Tripolitania
Tripolitanian_heritage:0 "Tripolitanian Heritage"
Tripolitanian_heritage_desc:0 "Tripolitania was a region known for three cities, Sabratha, Leptis Magna, and Oyat (Greek Oea). Established during the archaic period and most likely over the foundations of native Libyan villages set in prosperous geographical positions, these cities sat at the periphery of Carthaginian control of eastern North Africa, and any hold of a people over the area was tenuous when considering not only the powerful cultures along the Nile and in Cyrenaica, but also the many nomadic tribes, including the well-feared Garamantes, which were equally capable of both raiding and trading. This tenuous hold was proven when the Greek rulers from Cyrenaica took hold of Oyat the original Phoenician colonists and referred to it as the Greek Oea before the Carthaginians retook it and incorporated it into their sphere of control."

Dodekaschoinos_heritage_desc:0 "A frontier state created by the Ptolemies in order to act as a cultural and political buffer between a Greek Egypt waiting to rebel and the Nubian (Meroe) sphere waiting to take advantage of the cultural dilemma in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Dodekaschoinos, or the 12 cities, was meant to help integrate and pacify the upper Egyptian and Nubian populations which did not appreciate the existence of Greek Pharaohs. The ancient temples built in the area, especially the one at Philae, dedicated to Isis, were the main focus for the activities of the garrison regent, with several of the Ptolemies beginning a tradition of giving all the income of the 12 cities to the temples of both Egyptian and Nubian gods such as that of Mandulis. When the people were pacified, their societal needs met by the appeasement of their gods, this buffer state allowed for continuous long-distance trade along the Nile with the Nubian world, which would result in many exotic goods and war elephants find their way up through the 12 cities and into Ptolemaic Egypt itself where they would assist in the war efforts against the many diadochi."
#Blemmia
Blemmian_heritage:0 "Blemmian Heritage"
Blemmian_heritage_desc:0 "It is known from writings that the Blemmyes existed at least as early as the Nubian king Anlamani in the 7th century BCE, but they are likely far older, having been continuous inhabitants of the desert-layden region east of the Nile and on the coast of the Red Sea. Influenced by a mixture of Egyptian and Meroitic cultures, the Blemmyes, at a time, worshiped well-known gods like Isis at Philae as well as southern divinities like Mandulis at Kalabsha. While outsiders have often referred to the Blemmyes as nomadic raiders, they controlled wealthy gold mines and mineral-rich regions and built many well-fortified and prosperous cities which may have housed a royal king or two."
#Alut
Alut_heritage:0 "Alutan Heritage"
Alut_heritage_desc:0 "Beginning at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, Alut has the benefit of Nile trade networks, the floodplains bringing a richness to the landscape, and the wealth of the mineral and metal deposits in the east which serve to be exported to Northern aristocracies such as the Kushites or the Macedonians in Ptolemaic Egypt. Possibly taking up the area as early as the 4th century BCE, the people of Alut came into regular conflict with the declining Kushite kingdom, as the land was desirable to all interested parties."

#Boras
Borasan_heritage:0 "Borasan Heritage"
Borasan_heritage_desc:0 "Centered around the watercourse of the Black Nile which branches off from the main Nile as it bends and then turns and winds its way up into the mountains, Boras survives as a thriving avenue of exotic trade. It is both connected to Kush and Egypt and, by extension, the Mediterranean sphere in the north, as well as the Axumite/Arabian conjunction near the entrance of the Red Sea. While the people may be seen by outsiders as uncivilized barbarians, those same outsiders are quite happy to import Boras elephants and rich metals in quite large quantities."
#Aksum
Axumite_heritage:0 "Aethiopian-Sabaean Heritage"
Axumite_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly born from the declining D`mt kingdom, Aksum grew to power as a centralized mixture of native Aetheopian and trade-induced Sabaean and South Arabian influences. This mixture of cultures led to monumental buildings worshiping different or mixed gods, and would lead to uniquely Axumite Semitic language. Aksum was also a major center for trade and resource distribution. Much of the ivory or elephants and rhinoceroses reaped from inland habits would wind up in Aksum before flowing out to the nearby ports like Adulis."
#Adoulia
Adoulian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Island"
Adoulian_heritage_desc:0 "Notably established by law, Adulis was a market port on the Red Sea, set opposite of the notable “Mountain Island,” which ships harbor at for safety. Possibly having gained its independence during the Classical Period with the disappearance of the D`mt kingdom in the 5th century BCE, the port town which may have once been a simple emporion became a much more popular trade city in a profitable location. It exported in great amounts both ivory and slaves, and was said to have been frequented most by the troglodytae and aethiopian natives from the interior lands."
#Gwanara
Gwanaran_heritage:0 "Gwanaran Heritage"
Gwanaran_heritage_desc:0 "Surrounded by mountains and forests fed by the source of the Black Nile which branches off eastwards of the main Nile river, Gwanara is home to the peoples the Mediterranean civilizations considered Troglodytae, cave-goers, Aethiopians, or Calf-Eaters, because they were seen as strange and oftentimes savage, hiding among the forests and exotic landscapes of southernmost known lands of greater Libya. Yet, it is from these lands and these people that the many riches of the area are produced and eventually end up in the hands of Macedonian aristocrats. This fact cannot be denied."
#Yeha
Yehan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Timber-Frame Builders"
Yehan_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly the capital of the old Somalian-Sabaean D`mt kingdom which disappeared from record in the 5th century BCE, Yeha was the site of at least one great palace and a temple dedicated to the Sabaean Moon God, Almaqah. The palace stands as one of if not the earliest timber-framed buildings in Eastern Africa, attesting to the master craftsmanship of the people living there. The city in which these monumental builds can be found nestled in a fertile valley, protected by protective mountains."
#Avalitia
Avalitian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Little but the Good"
Avalitian_heritage_desc:0 "Closest in travel to the Arabian shores on the opposite side of the Red Sea, Avalites was a port town which traded goods in small quantities but in great quality. This was especially the case when it came to Myrrh, that useful resin which flavors meals and covers the well-made product of the master carpenter. Those wishing to travel to Avalites had to do so by raft or boat, and those finding themselves in Avalites and wishing to leave had to do the same. This was especially true when it came to the frequent trade with the nearby Arabian town of Muza."
#Mundus
Mundus_heritage:0 "Mocrotun Heritage"
Mundus_heritage_desc:0 "One of the many city states which became an independent polity following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Mundus was larger in size than more periphery market towns, on the level of its westward neighbor, Malao. The port protected the harbored ships well, but may not have kept their sailors safe since the environment there has been considered ‘quarrelsome.’ Yet, while it imported many goods from all over, Mundus was best known for exporting a unique incense known as mocrotu, which was of better quality than the incense exported by the famous town of Mosylon, owner of the desirable Mosyllitic cinnamon."
#Opone
Opone_heritage:0 "Crown of the Horn Heritage"
Opone_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the tip of the Horn of Africa, Opone was one of the most well known cities with a port connecting the trade from India to the Red Sea, Egypt, and beyond. A city state having found independent rule following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Opone had always been a part of an incredibly rich history of cultural connection. In its graves lie relics of the ancient Mycenaeans as well as goods from all over the east and west. As for its own work, it was known to produce the greatest amount of cinnamon of any of the Somalian coastal cities, and it was known for having the greatest quality of tortoiseshell-wares in its markets."

What comes from these islands, sold by the so-called “Fish-Eaters,” for obvious reasons, are pearls in the hundreds and quality tortoiseshell and other marine-based wares. These products are what make the Alalaiou islands well-known, and they are favored by their proximity to the trading port of Adulis on the Libyan shore."
