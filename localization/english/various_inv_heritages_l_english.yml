tylosian_heritage_desc:0 "Tylos is an island off the coast of East Arabia. Famed for its cotton products, they are sold as far away as the Indian courts and even on the other side of the Arabian desert."
#Socosia
Socosian_heritage:0 "Socosian Heritage"
Socosian_heritage_desc:0 "Secluded, set along the Mauretanian mountains brushing against the Iberian Sea, the Socossi maintain access both to the many Phoenician and Punic trading posts and colonies dotting the coast for access to the wider Mediterranean, as well as the safety of the mountains. It is said that the Libyan god Anti stood on top of the peaks as he challenged passers-bye and fought even Herakles. Perhaps they have inherited his titanic strength."
#Mauretania
Mauretanian_heritage:0 "Mauretanian Heritage"
Mauretanian_heritage_desc:0 "The kingdom of the Mauri, Mauretania, later coming to refer to the region touching the the sea beyond the Pillars of Herakles (Mauretania Tingitana), but also the region next to it (Mauretania Caesariensis), was a confederation of hill-based tribes brought together under the power of a few ruling ‘familiae’. The Mauri were a blessing and a curse to the colonial powers in the Libyan and European continents, trading rich goods from the mountainous interior lands with outsiders while also raiding their settlements on occasion, even crossing the sea itself to raid the Iberian region of Baetica."
#Nectiberia
Nectiberian_heritage:0 "Nectiberean Heritage"
Nectiberian_heritage_desc:0 "Settled at the foot of the Atlas mountain range, the Nectiberi can be found stuck between a rock and a hard place, literally, with two significant competitors in the notorious Autololes to their west and the raid-happy Mauri to their north. Their only means of escape, should an invasion or aggressive migration occur, would be through the mountains themselves. Luckily, they have the Pyrrhon Plain at their side, so sustenance is not one of their many problems."
#Autolalia
Autolalian_heritage:0 "Autolalian Heritage"
Autolalian_heritage_desc:0 "Strabo describes them as “the most powerful of the Libyan nations” while Pliny the Elder fears their ferocious nature. If it is to be believed that they once had Iarbas as their king, then Dido/Elissa and great Carthage too once feared their tribe because Iarbas was so aggressive a suitor of the Punic queen. While a Gaetulian tribe, the Autololes were more well known for their ravenous behavior, having fed on the flesh of terrible wild beasts."
#Daphnitaea
Daphnitaean_heritage:0 "Daphnitaean Heritage"
Daphnitaean_heritage_desc:0 "Spread farther away from the feet of mountains and too far from the shore, the Daphnitae are confined to the vast horizon of endless desert which expands seemingly forever in all directions. Perhaps one of them may see a lone camel passing by, a lost Garamantine warrior from ages past, riding by on an old chariot, or they might see any sort of torturous vision appear amidst the hot haze of the homogenous sands. So is the life of those living among the dunes, traveling from watering hole to watering hole."
#Capariensis
Capariensian_heritage:0 "Capariensian Heritage"
Capariensian_heritage_desc:0 "Confined to the hills which serve as tactical positions in case of ambush or invasion, the Capariensi must be a wary and overly cautious people in order to survive, their backs against the last visible rocks before the endless desert. There is little to look forward to in life, save for arrival at the next oasis where one can forget the taste of dust and sand for a little while."
#Abannaea
Abannaean_heritage:0 "Abannaean Heritage"
Abannaean_heritage_desc:0 "Connected to both the busy worlds of the eastern Numidian and Gaetulian tribes and the greener parts of north western Libya as well as the rocky, sandy corridor past the final mountains before the endless desert, the Abannae are in a unique position to play on the weaknesses of nearby greater powers while remaining in the safety of their territory, which few wish to follow them into."
#Lixitae
Lixitan_heritage:0 "Lixitan Heritage"
Lixitan_heritage_desc:0 "The only friendly and helpful natives which Hanno the Navigator found useful enough to take aboard his ship as translators for the remainder of his journey, the Lixitae were a unique tribe among many - much more favorable than their vicious Atutololian neighbors. Perhaps these people are so uniquely friendly because they happen to live in such a fertile river valley hidden between the mountains."
#Perorsia
Perorsian_heritage:0 "Perorsian Heritage"
Perorsian_heritage_desc:0 "Living north of the river Daras, where it passes up into the mountains, the Perorsi were adjacent to the wild Canarii who shared their food with dogs. They live at the foot of the Atlas mountains, near both the black, sandy, desert horizon and the strange forest with dangerous beasts."
#Canaria
Canarian_heritage:0 "Canarian Heritage"
Canarian_heritage_desc:0 "These people, the Canarii, are named so because they are known to share their meals with dogs and spread the entrails of their prey, wild beasts, on a common plate. Their home is the lush forest around Mount Atlas which is home to all manners of beast including, at the largest, elephants and, at smallest, serpents. This forest home can be found surrounded by a black desert, peppered with dark, rocky sand coming from below the ground."
#Massaesylia
Massaesylian_heritage:0 "Massaesylian Heritage"
Massaesylian_heritage_desc:0 "Bordering the Mauri in the west and controlling the western confederation of Numidian tribes, the Massaesylii were able to consolidate cultural and political control over many individual ‘familiae’ in response to the pressure of Mediterranean powers such as Carthage, as well as the consolidation and recognition of other segmented groups such as the Massylii in the east with whom they were antagonistic in their attempts to bring together all the Numidian tribes under one ruler. Still, they were fierce on the battlefield with their famous Numidian cavalry, as were their adjacent rivals."
#Massylia
Massylian_heritage:0 "Massylian Heritage"
Massylian_heritage_desc:0 "Most likely beginning as a few ‘familiae,’ the Massylii took over political and cultural control of many Numidian tribes during the process of becoming a protectorate state of Carthage, held together by the recognition of a great power and the intricacies of tribal segmentation and consolidation. Like all Numidian tribes, the Massylii were known for their tactics with the swift and powerful Numidian horses and cavalry divisions, which they used to serve both Carthage and other powers, and also to wage war on their Massaesyli counterparts. Their subjugation is ironic and insulting, considering how Carthage once paid tribute to Numidian kings."
#Gaetulia
Heritage_of_the_Great_Invading_Asparagus:0 "Heritage of the Great Invading Asparagus"
Heritage_of_the_Great_Invading_Asparagus_desc:0 "The Gaetuli are often an indiscernible people, ranging across a vast landscape and having many sub tribes which can only be called “Gaetuli”. Yet the main body of the Gaetulian tribes, on the border with and often mixing both biologically and culturally with the related Numidian tribes, has been notable for quite a few things. These include invading everyone around them, indiscriminately, trading their exotic and dangerous wildlife, such as the Gaetulian lion, off to Mediterranean powers for sport, and growing asparagus of a size greater than two men and thick as the reeds found in the marshes of Cyprus. So it has been that these people are a great threat to their neighbors, and a constant source of amazement."
#Musulamia
Musulamian_heritage:0 "Musulamian Heritage"
Musulamian_heritage_desc:0 "A confederation of smaller Gaetulian tribes, the Musulamii inhabited the desert region west and south of the Carthaginian coastline. Maintaining many customs of the general Gaetuli peoples but identifying as their own political segmentation, the Musulamii shared close boundaries and bonds with the neighboring Numidian tribes of the Massylii and contributed to the mixed ethnic makeup of the area, held together socially by a shared linguistic base."
#Gyzantia
Tritonian_heritage:0 "Tritonian Heritage"
Tritonian_heritage_desc:0 "Setting themselves up along the shores of Lake Tritonis, where Athene Tritogeneia was cared for by the nymphs under Triton after her birth, the Gyzantes lived in a wondrous and prosperous land hidden among the deserts. The Libyan goddess Neith also possibly originated here and became the model for Greek Athena. It is said that there were many bees around the lake, and that the Gyzantes made good use of them, extracting immeasurable amounts of honey. It is also said that they painted themselves red and ate the flesh of monkeys which could be found, innumerable, among the hills. Perhaps these men and women even rode the elephants living there, frequenting the shore of the great lake, its tributary river, or the many spacious watering holes."
#Gindania

Heritage_of_the_Leather_Legged_Women_desc:0 "The Gindanes are notable for living near the sea, having once occupied the isle of Meninx long before the Lotus-Eaters, the Lotophagi, came to live in that place and eat of the lotus fruit which intoxicates the mind and turns away any person from life outside the shade of the lotus tree. Herodotus reports that the women within the Gindanes tribe would show how greatly they had been loved by the men with the addition of a leather anklet after a night spent with each new man. In this way, all the people knew which woman had been loved by the most men."
#Phazania
Pheasant_heritage:0 "Pheasant Heritage"
Pheasant_heritage_desc:0 "Building their civilization around the oasis town of Ghadames, the pearl of the desert, the Phazanii tribe (possibly meaning ‘country of the pheasants’) straddled the realms of Carthaginian influence and the greater desert beyond, to the south and the east. The Phasanii gave their name to the region known as the Fezzan, which no ancient power could subdue."
#Makae

Heritage_of_the_Ostrich_Shield_desc:0 "Herodotus reports that these people “by letting the locks about the crown of their head grow long, while they clip them close everywhere else, make their hair resemble a crest” (Histories Book 4). It is likely that, because they are known for their ostrich shields, that they worked ostrich skin over a wooden base and were, to a man, as unique as their ostrich. These people live below the notable “Hill of the Graces,” which bears a thick forest and is greener than all the barren wastes of Libya."
#Machylia
Androgynous_heritage:0 "Androgynous Heritage"
Androgynous_heritage_desc:0 "A subtribe of the Macae, breaking off on their own at a time unknown, the Machlyes were a unique people who lie largely within myth and rumor. It is said that when they are even children they try their hand at basic warfare, fighting each other and their neighbors with sticks and stones. It is also said that they maintain halves of both man and woman, having on their body the breast of both a man and a woman, one to a side."
#Psyllia
Snake_Bite_heritage:0 "Snake Bite Heritage"
Snake_Bite_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that these ancient peoples test the strength and worthiness of their children with the venom of the snake, as they also do their wives for the purpose of bearing these strong children. Their origin is unknown, though it is known that they are old - oh so old - and have been cast adrift on the arid deserts by either high gales of searing wind or the strength of the nomadic Nasamones. They remain, to all outsiders, known as snake charmers, posessers of the most exotic means of both healing and poisoning."
#Nasamonia
Nasamonian_heritage:0 "Nasamonian Heritage"
Nasamonian_heritage_desc:0 "A nomadic Numidian tribe traveling along the eastern deserts, stopping at the rich Augila and Siwa oases where the only life in the area grows far to the south of lush Cyrenaica (there they pick dates and pour crushed locust remains over milk), the Nasamones were a fierce tribe who once lived near the coastline of the Mediterranean but were forced out of the area by the many Greek colonists such as those Therans who founded Cyrene. Noted for supposedly defeating the snake charmer Psylli in war, the Nasamones were never truly subject to anyone, and would be great obstacles for any future conquerors in the region."
#Cetiania
Cetianian_heritage:0 "Cetianian Heritage"
Cetianian_heritage_desc:0 "The Cetiani live by and control the upper Mulucha (modern Moulouya) river, which comes from the Greek meaning “a marsh mallow” -  yum. With the safety of the Atlas mountain range at their back and the precious and often exotic goods found in that area, the Cetiani have quite the assortment of things to send downstream in order to trade with the riverside Phoneician/Punic settlement of Bouhout and coastal Rusaddir."
