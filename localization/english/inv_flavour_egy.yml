### Hippocrates' Kosan Asylum Decision

kosan_asylum:0 "Hippocrates' Kosan Asylum"
kosan_asylum_desc:0 "War is such a terrible thing. Does it not wet the eye to see the battle weary, the displaced, all uncertain travelers, trodding down the road, their heads held down? Is there nothing we can do? Perhaps there is some final safe haven, a paradise to be found for these lonely souls. Perhaps they could use the healing of Hippocrates. We all could. Then, it is decided - Kos will be the last vestige for the wayward warrior and the wandering, well-meaning men and women of the world. Let there be an asylum there, centered around the old Asklepion and the sacred groves which grow there. Let the fraught, the free, and the fearful go there and rest out this long war. Let us build this Elysium for them, for we may one day find ourselves needing some place to live out days in exile or in frustration."
