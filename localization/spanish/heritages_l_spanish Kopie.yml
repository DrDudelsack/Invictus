trapezan_heritage:0 "Legado Trapezunto"
trapezan_heritage_desc:0 "A Sinopian colony founded around 756BCE by Milesian traders, Trapezunta was a cultural melting pot, originally home to several caucasian tribes, and was a trade gateway from the Pontos Euxinos into the Achaemenid Empire and the east at large. Fighting his way out of Anatolia, Xenophon recorded in his Anabasis that he and his 10,000 mercenaries got "provisions in Trapezus by purchase, for the Trapezuntians provided us a market, and in return for the honours they bestowed upon us and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we paid them like honours; if any of the barbarians were their friends, we kept our hands off them, while upon their enemies, against whom they would themselves lead us, we wrought all the harm we could" (5.5.14)."
kerasous_heritage:0 "Legado Kerasus"
kerasous_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly coming from the Greek: κερασός "cherry", Pliny the Elder writes that the first cherry was exported from this colony town to Europe in Roman times by means of Sulla's close friend Lucius Lucullus. Settled in the 6th century BCE by Sinopian colonists, this port town was also famously visited by Xenophon, as recorded in his Anabasis."
kos_heritage:0 "Legado de Cos"
kos_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the mythological autochthonous king Merops, Kos existed throughout ancient history as a place of wealth, learning, and luxury production. Freed from Persia's grip following the Greco-Persian Wars (later only shortly ruled by the Carian satrapy for a while), the island remained largely independent around the great Aegean leagues, Alexander's Empire, and the raging Diadochi, gaining a form of oligarchic self rule even while under the 'ownership' of the Ptolemies, who used it as a place for educating their dynasty. Kos also maintained a recognition for fine wine, a bevy of silk clothes, and the island's famous Asclepion."
commagenian_heritage:0 "Legado Comageno"
commagenian_heritage_desc:0 "The region of Commagene, while its pre-Hellenistic age history is blurry, appears to have a long and continuous footnote in history stretching all the way back to its time as a Syro-Hittite kingdom referred to in the 15th century BCE as "Kummaha", near identical with the later Archaic city of "Kummuh", thought to be the same site/city as Hellenistic Samosata, where the Attic poet Lucian supposedly came from. Existing possibly as a satrap of the Armenian Kingdom before being a province under the Seleucids, the area boasts a multicultural demographic, being a melting pot for Hellenic and Iranian cultures, best seen in the royal sanctuary on Mount Nemrut."
bambyce_heritage:0 "Legado de los Sacerdotes-Reyes Arameos"
bambyce_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the famous temple for its patron deity: Atargatis, Bambyce's history traces back to its annexation by the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BCE. Coinage suggests that it was ruled by Aramean priest-kings near the end of Achaemenid domination and transitioned to Seleucid monarchical governance following the collapse of Alexander's Empire. The city prospered under the yoke of Macedonian/Seleucid rule, becoming 'the place' to stop at between Antioch and Selucia on the Tigris, eventually becoming the richest city in Roman Syria."
olbe_cilicia_heritage:0 "Legado Olbe"
olbe_cilicia_heritage_desc:0 "The only independent Cilician Kingdom, Olbe was supposedly founded by Ajax, son of Teucer. It became a pirate's haven after the ruling dynastic priests of Cilicia Tracheia fell to chaotic, short-lived tyrants and fell further into disarray after those. These Cilician pirates would later reappear in notable records during the Servile Wars, offering Spartacus a chance to cross from mainland Italy into Sicily before taking his money and leaving him and his army stranded."
laranda_heritage:0 "Legado Larende"
laranda_heritage_desc:0 "The greatest marauders from eastern Anatolia, the Lycaonians of Laranda lost much of their glory following the invasions of the Makedonian empire and the following infighting between the diadochi rulers - notably, Perdiccas destroyed the settlement in 322 BCE, after which habitation gradually resumed."
